// Where a DTO lives, because the API has forty of them across six files and the rule had never been
// written down — which is how a file like this one becomes a drawer:
//
//   a shape a SERVICE returns          lives with its service interface
//                                      (ProfileUser, RoomSummary, PlayerPurse, ArticleFeed …)
//   a shape only the ENDPOINT builds   lives here
//                                      (LoginResponse, SsoTicketResponse, HealthResponse …)
//
// The test is one question: could this record exist without an HTTP route? `PlayerProfile` is what
// reading a profile means and would survive the website being deleted, so it belongs to the service.
// `LoginResponse` is "did that POST leave you with an avatar to pick" — a fact about one endpoint's
// answer, nothing else.
//
// One record bends it on purpose. `TwoFactorEnrolmentResponse` mirrors `MfaEnrolment`, which the
// service already returns, rather than exposing it: that type is shared with the dashboard, and a
// field the dashboard needs one day would otherwise land in the website's generated types by
// accident. A copy of two strings is cheaper than that coupling.
