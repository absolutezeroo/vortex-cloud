// predicates -- player, no room, no wired chest, not deleted -- and the schema offered it only the
// simple foreign-key index on player_id, so a player with fifty thousand items had all fifty
// thousand rows read and filtered in the server for every one of them. It is the most-run query in
// the hotel: every login, and every reload after a trade, a placement or a purchase.
// jukebox_id joined the key because it joined the predicate: a disk loaded into a jukebox is out of
// its owner's hands exactly like one in a chest, and leaving the column out of the index would make
// the hotel's most-run query stop covering and start reading rows to throw them away.
