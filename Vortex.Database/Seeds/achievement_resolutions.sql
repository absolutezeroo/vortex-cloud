-- What a resolution statue offers. Keyed on the achievement so re-running is a no-op.
--
-- Deliberately not every achievement in the hotel. Two are left out on purpose:
-- AllTimeHotelPresence, because a challenge measured in hours online is not winnable inside a
-- week for anyone who has to sleep, and GamePlayed, because a hotel with the games off would show
-- a row nobody can ever advance.
--
-- target_level_offset is 1 everywhere: one level up from wherever the player stands. Raise it for
-- an achievement whose levels are cheap.
