/// The relay half is the outbox: an operation writes its event with its terminal transition, and
/// this publishes it afterwards. Under normal conditions the flow publishes its own event and marks
/// it relayed within milliseconds, and this finds nothing. It exists for the crash in between, which
/// used to lose the event outright — and with it the quest progress and the daily task it feeds.
/// Delivery is at-least-once, which is why the consumers that change player state deduplicate by
/// operation id.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The escalation half does not repair anything. Resuming a half-delivered purchase needs per-flow
/// knowledge this does not have; what it does is stop an operation from sitting in
/// <see cref="CommerceOperationState.Pivoted"/> forever without anyone knowing, which was the state
/// of every commerce failure in this codebase until now.
