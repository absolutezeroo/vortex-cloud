# Vortex Cloud

## 5-Minute Quickstart
1. Clone and enter the repo.
2. Run bootstrap once.
3. Set your local DB connection string.
4. Run the app in Development mode.

Clone:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> vortex-cloud
cd vortex-cloud
```

Bootstrap (PowerShell):

```powershell
pwsh -File scripts/bootstrap.ps1
```

Bootstrap (bash/zsh):

```bash
sh scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

Set `Vortex:Database:ConnectionString` in `appsettings.Development.json`, then run:

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT="Development"; dotnet run --project Vortex.Main/Vortex.Main.csproj
```

bash/zsh:

```bash
DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT=Development dotnet run --project Vortex.Main/Vortex.Main.csproj
```

## What This Repository Is
`Vortex.Cloud.sln` is the main Vortex emulator solution.
It includes the host executable (`Vortex.Main`), domain modules (`Vortex.Rooms`, `Vortex.Players`, `Vortex.Database`, and others), networking/message layers, and plugin infrastructure.

## Tooling Baseline
- .NET SDK 9.x (pinned via `global.json`)
- Git
- MySQL running locally (or reachable dev instance)

Check SDK:

```bash
dotnet --version
```

## Local Configuration
- `appsettings.json` contains shared defaults.
- `appsettings.Development.json` is local-only and gitignored.
- The bootstrap script creates `appsettings.Development.json` from `appsettings.json` if missing.

## Démarrage par conteneur (Container Startup)
`Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore` and `docker-compose.yml` at the repository root build and run
`Vortex.Main` plus a MySQL 8 instance. They are build/run artefacts only — no application code
depends on them, and running the emulator from the SDK as described above is unaffected.

### `docker compose up`

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

The `vortex` service waits on `depends_on: mysql: condition: service_healthy`. This is required,
not cosmetic: `Vortex.Database/Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` resolves the server
version with `ServerVersion.AutoDetect(connectionString)` whenever
`Vortex:Database:MySqlServerVersion` is unset (the default). `AutoDetect` opens a real MySQL
connection *during DI configuration*, before the host is built and outside the reach of
`EnableRetryOnFailure`, so a database that is not yet accepting connections is a hard startup
failure rather than a retried transient.

**The schema is not created for you.** Migrations are never applied at host startup — see
[Applying migrations](#applying-migrations) below. On a fresh volume, start the stack, apply the
migrations once, then restart `vortex`.

### What is exposed, on which ports

| Host port | Container | Service |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 30000 | `vortex` | Game client, raw TCP socket (SuperSocket) |
| 30001 | `vortex` | Game client, WebSocket socket (SuperSocket) |
| 8080 | `vortex` | Vortex web API — Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger` |
| 9000 | `vortex` | Operator dashboard SPA + API — `http://localhost:9000`, Swagger at `/swagger` |
| 3307 | `mysql` | MySQL 8 (3307 on the host to avoid a local MySQL already on 3306) |

The Orleans silo (11111) and gateway (3000) ports are deliberately not published: the stack runs a
single in-process silo.

MySQL data lives in the named volume `vortex-mysql-data`, so `docker compose down` keeps the
schema and `docker compose down -v` destroys it.

### The `ListenerSecurity` guard, and why the compose file opts in

`Vortex.Primitives/Hosting/ListenerSecurity.cs` refuses to start an HTTP listener bound to a
non-local address with HTTPS disabled, because both HTTP surfaces carry credentials and a session
cookie. Its `IsLocalHost` treats `0.0.0.0`, `::`, `*` and `+` as **not** local — they accept
traffic on every interface, which is precisely the remote-exposure case.

Inside a container, a listener bound to `127.0.0.1` is unreachable: published ports are forwarded
to the container's external interface. The listeners must bind `0.0.0.0`, so the guard fires.

The compose file does not bypass or modify the guard. It sets the two opt-in keys the code already
reads:

| Configuration key | Declared in | Environment variable in `docker-compose.yml` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Vortex:WebApi:AllowInsecureRemoteHttp` | `Vortex.WebApi/Configuration/WebApiConfig.cs` | `VORTEX__Vortex__WebApi__AllowInsecureRemoteHttp` |
| `Vortex:Observability:DashboardAllowInsecureRemoteHttp` | `Vortex.Observability/Configuration/ObservabilityConfig.cs` | `VORTEX__Vortex__Observability__DashboardAllowInsecureRemoteHttp` |

With those set, `ValidateListener` returns `AllowedWithWarning` instead of `Refused`, and the
warning is still logged on every start.

**This is a local development setting only.** It is acceptable here because the published ports
are meant to be reached from `localhost` on the developer's machine. Anywhere the ports are
reachable from a network, remove those two variables and either enable HTTPS on the listeners or
bind them to a local address behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy.

Note that the two game sockets are configured through *unprefixed* variables
(`serverOptions__TcpServer__listeners__0__ip`, `serverOptions__WebSocketServer__listeners__0__ip`).
`Vortex.Networking/NetworkManager.cs` builds them with `SuperSocketHostBuilder.Create()`, which
bottoms out in `Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)` — a separate generic host with its own
configuration root. The `VORTEX__` prefix registered in `Vortex.Main/Program.cs` does not reach it;
`CreateDefaultBuilder` reads unprefixed environment variables. `ListenerSecurity` does not police
these two — it guards the HTTP surfaces only.

### Applying migrations
Migrations are **not** applied automatically when the host starts; when to migrate is an operations
decision. Apply them explicitly against the running `mysql` service.

The runtime image is intentionally SDK-free, so run the EF tooling from a throwaway SDK container
joined to the compose network, with the repository mounted:

```bash
docker compose up -d mysql

docker run --rm \
  --network vortex-cloud_default \
  -v "$PWD:/src" -w /src/Vortex.Database \
  -e Vortex__Database__ConnectionString="Server=mysql;Port=3306;Database=vortex;User Id=vortex;Password=vortex-dev;" \
  -e Vortex__Database__ServerVersion="8.0-mysql" \
  mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0 \
  sh -c 'dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef && export PATH="$PATH:/root/.dotnet/tools" && dotnet ef database update'
```

PowerShell: replace `$PWD` with `${PWD}` and the line continuations with backticks.

Details that matter:
- `dotnet ef` is not in `.config/dotnet-tools.json`, hence the `dotnet tool install` in the command.
- The working directory must be a project directory: `VortexDbContextFactory` reads
  `appsettings.json` from `Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()/..`, i.e. the repository root.
- Both variables are **unprefixed**. That factory builds its own configuration with a plain
  `AddEnvironmentVariables()`, so `VORTEX__…` would be ignored, and it reads
  `Vortex:Database:ServerVersion` (not `MySqlServerVersion`, which is the runtime host's key).
  Pinning the version skips `AutoDetect`.

From the host instead of a container, the same thing works against the published port:

```bash
cd Vortex.Database
Vortex__Database__ConnectionString="Server=127.0.0.1;Port=3307;Database=vortex;User Id=vortex;Password=vortex-dev;" \
Vortex__Database__ServerVersion="8.0-mysql" \
dotnet ef database update
```

### Real secrets outside development
Every credential in `docker-compose.yml` is a development value committed to the repository, so it
is public: the MySQL passwords, the RSA handshake keypair and the IP-hash secret. The compose file
is a local dev stack, not a deployment.

To run this anywhere else:
- Move every `VORTEX__…` value out of the compose file. It reaches the host through
  `AddEnvironmentVariables(prefix: "VORTEX__")` in `Vortex.Main/Program.cs`, so any mechanism that
  sets process environment variables works: an untracked `.env` file referenced with
  `env_file:` (`.env` is already in `.dockerignore`), Docker/Swarm secrets read into the variable
  at entrypoint, or the orchestrator's own secret store (Kubernetes `Secret` via `envFrom`, ECS
  task-definition secrets, systemd `EnvironmentFile=`).
- Generate a fresh RSA keypair — `openssl genrsa -3 1024` — and configure the client with the
  matching modulus. `CryptoConfigValidator` rejects the `CHANGE_ME` placeholders, so a
  half-configured host fails at startup rather than at the first handshake.
- Set a real `Vortex:Authentication:IpHashSecret`. Outside Development the validator refuses the
  repository defaults, since a known HMAC key makes the hashed IPs in auth events reversible.
- Drop `DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT: Development`. Outside Development,
  `Vortex.Main/Extensions/HostApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs` refuses to start Orleans with
  localhost clustering plus in-memory grain storage, which is what this single-container stack
  uses. A real deployment needs `Vortex:Orleans:ClusteringProvider` and
  `Vortex:Orleans:GrainStorageProvider` set to `adonet` — or an explicit
  `AllowUnclusteredOutsideDevelopment` if a single node with non-durable Orleans state is genuinely
  what you want.
- Drop the two `AllowInsecureRemoteHttp` opt-ins and terminate TLS in front of the listeners.

## Quality Model (Two-Phase)
- Fast local commit check:
  - `dotnet build Vortex.Main/Vortex.Main.csproj -t:VortexCloudFastCheck`
- Full quality gate (pre-push + CI):
  - `dotnet build Vortex.Main/Vortex.Main.csproj -t:VortexCloudQualityGate`
- AI policy rollout phase:
  - Default is `VortexAIPolicyPhase=1` (warn-first).
  - Preview strict mode with `-p:VortexAIPolicyPhase=2`.

Hooks are repository-managed in `.githooks`:
- `pre-commit` runs the fast check.
- `pre-push` runs the full quality gate.

## Build Scope Matrix
| Command | Scope | Default? | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dotnet build Vortex.Main/Vortex.Main.csproj` | Core emulator only | Yes | Normal core development and CI-compatible local checks |
| `dotnet build Vortex.Cloud.sln` | All projects currently in solution (including sample plugin) | No | One-window integrated core + plugin work |
| `dotnet build ../turbo-sample-plugin/TurboSamplePlugin/TurboSamplePlugin.csproj` | Sample plugin only | No | Plugin-only iteration |

`TurboSamplePlugin` intentionally stays in `Vortex.Cloud.sln` for IDE convenience, but the default repo build contract is project-scoped to `Vortex.Main`.

## Daily Commands
- Core build (default): `dotnet build Vortex.Main/Vortex.Main.csproj`
- Integrated solution build (optional): `dotnet build Vortex.Cloud.sln`
- Plugin build only (optional): `dotnet build ../turbo-sample-plugin/TurboSamplePlugin/TurboSamplePlugin.csproj`
- Fast checks: `dotnet build Vortex.Main/Vortex.Main.csproj -t:VortexCloudFastCheck`
- Full quality gate: `dotnet build Vortex.Main/Vortex.Main.csproj -t:VortexCloudQualityGate`
- Run in Development: `dotnet run --project Vortex.Main/Vortex.Main.csproj`

## Local Dev Plugins
Plugin loading supports both the runtime plugin folder and dev-specific paths:
- Default folder: `<runtime>/plugins`
- Optional config: `Vortex:Plugin:DevPluginPaths`

Example:

```json
{
  "Vortex": {
    "Plugin": {
      "DevPluginPaths": [
        "C:/Users/you/RiderProjects/turbo-sample-plugin/TurboSamplePlugin/bin/Debug/net10.0"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If the same plugin key exists in both places, `DevPluginPaths` wins and a warning is logged.

### Plugin project setup
Your plugin's `.csproj` must copy `manifest.json` to the build output:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <Content Include="manifest.json">
    <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
  </Content>
</ItemGroup>
```

You can list multiple plugin paths in `DevPluginPaths` when developing several plugins at once.

### Two-terminal dev workflow
Terminal 1 (run emulator):

```bash
dotnet run --project Vortex.Main
```

Terminal 2 (watch plugin):

```bash
cd C:/path/to/your-plugin
dotnet watch build
```

When `dotnet watch` rebuilds your plugin, Vortex Cloud detects the new DLL and hot-reloads the plugin in-process.

### Plugin hot-reload limitations
- Grain types cannot be hot-reloaded because Orleans grain type registration happens at silo startup.
- Memory may grow over many reloads if assembly references are retained; restart periodically during long sessions.

### Integrated plugin dev loop (single terminal flow)
Canonical integrated workflow lives in the plugin repo:
- Guide: `../turbo-sample-plugin/README.md`
- PowerShell: `pwsh -File ../turbo-sample-plugin/scripts/dev-integrated.ps1`
- bash/zsh: `sh ../turbo-sample-plugin/scripts/dev-integrated.sh`

## Orleans Notes
Vortex Cloud uses Orleans as its core runtime model for stateful domain workflows.
For project-specific Orleans guidance, see `docs/orleans.md`.
For a concrete end-to-end trace of a single packet through handlers, grains, and streams, see `docs/walkthroughs/request-lifecycle.md`.

## Troubleshooting
### MySQL connection errors
If you see `Unable to connect to any of the specified MySQL hosts`:
1. Verify `Vortex:Database:ConnectionString` in `appsettings.Development.json`.
2. Verify MySQL host/port are reachable.
3. Verify no `VORTEX__...` environment variables override your local setting.

### Development file not loading
1. Ensure `DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT=Development` when running.
2. Confirm `appsettings.Development.json` exists at repo root.

### Quality check failures
1. Run `dotnet tool restore`.
2. Run `dotnet csharpier .`.
3. Run `dotnet format style`.
4. Run `dotnet format analyzers`.
5. Re-run `dotnet build Vortex.Main/Vortex.Main.csproj -t:VortexCloudQualityGate`.

### Solution build fails but core build passes
If `dotnet build Vortex.Cloud.sln` fails because of plugin project state, use the default core build command:

```bash
dotnet build Vortex.Main/Vortex.Main.csproj
```
