# Wrapper around `dotnet ef` for VortexDbContext.
#
# It exists because three things are easy to get wrong and none of them fail loudly:
#   - the working directory (VortexDbContextFactory reads appsettings.json from `cwd/..`);
#   - the connection string variable, which is UNPREFIXED here -- the runtime's `VORTEX__` prefix
#     is ignored by the design-time factory, so a `VORTEX__`-spelled variable silently does nothing;
#   - the server version, which must be pinned or `ServerVersion.AutoDetect` opens a real
#     connection and authoring a migration needs a running database.
#
#   scripts/ef.ps1 migrations add AddThing
#   scripts/ef.ps1 database update
#   scripts/ef.ps1 migrations list
#   scripts/ef.ps1 migrations script --idempotent --output artifacts/migrations.sql
#
# Override either value by setting it before the call:
#   $env:Vortex__Database__ConnectionString = "..."   # default: appsettings.Development.json
#   $env:Vortex__Database__ServerVersion    = "8.4-mysql"
