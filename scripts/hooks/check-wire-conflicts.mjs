// Ratchet on the wire disagreements the specs already compute and nothing reads.
//
// `Vortex.Specs.Cli -- conflicts --kind field_count` knows, for every packet, how many fields each
// source says it carries: the official client's own code, the reference emulators, and us. When our
// count differs from the CLIENT's count, either the client parses fields we never wrote or we write
// fields it never reads, and both desynchronize everything after that field. Nothing in the build,
// the tests or grep sees it; the symptom is a dialog that never opens.
//
// The list is a triage queue, not a bug list. Read the packet before you change it.
//
// Two things make an entry appear that is not a bug, and knowing them saves re-deriving them:
//
//   1. A loop in a client parser reads as its body's fields. ConflictDetector collapses runs marked
//      "inside a repeated block" so `count + array` compares against `count + loop body`, which is
//      what `incoming/AcceptFriend` was. Already handled.
//   2. A parser that delegates -- `new SomeEntry(wrapper)` inside the loop -- hides those reads.
//      As3ClientAnalyzer follows one level of that now, and WireLayoutExtractor follows any call
//      that hands our packet to another method (the test is the packet, not the method's name).
//      What NEITHER side follows is delegation through a *method*: `entry.parse(wrapper)` on an
//      object, or `Helper.parseObjectData(wrapper)` on a class. That undercounts the CLIENT, so an
//      entry where the client's number looks too small for the message is probably this. It is the
//      single commonest shape left -- the whole ObjectAdd/ItemAdd/Objects/Items family is it.
//   3. The client guards optional trailing reads with `bytesAvailable > 0`. Sending fewer fields than
//      it can read is then legal and intended, not a truncation: HanditemConfiguration reads four
//      booleans that way and we send one.
//
// History, so nobody re-derives it. Until 2026-08-25 the client scanner bound headers only to
// composers, so 17 of 805 outgoing packets had any evidence from the build this emulator targets --
// every outgoing comparison was against a client from 2016, and that is where the original 23
// baselined entries came from. Following the parser behind each MessageEvent wrapper took outgoing
// evidence to 514; the list went 23 -> 64 (disagreements with the RIGHT client, for the first time),
// then to 46 once loops and constructor delegation were understood on both sides.
//
// **All 45 that stand have now been read against the WIN63 AS3.** Every one is an artifact of the
// three shapes above, or a composer that writes nothing and is tracked as such elsewhere. The list is
// therefore a ratchet and not a queue: it exists so a NEW disagreement fails the gate on the commit
// that introduces it, and an entry appearing in it is news.
//
// Two real findings came out of the reading, both fixed:
//   - AcceptFriendResult was sent on 3407, which WIN63 hands to its self-donation handler. It is 3707.
//   - RentableSpaceStatus wrote a trailing CurrencyName that the client, Arcturus and Nitro all stop
//     before. Removed.
//
// 2026-08-26, entry 46 -- WiredEnvironment (2827), client 2 / vortex 3. Not a disagreement: the
// client reads a boolean, then guards `bytesAvailable > 0` around a count and a `readString()` in a
// while loop. Neither scanner follows a read inside a loop inside a guard, so the client is counted
// at bool+int and this emulator at bool+int+string for the same bytes. The real order is pinned by
// Vortex.Revisions.Tests/UserDefinedRoomEvents/WiredClickUserWireTests, read off _SafeCls_3496.
//
// And one that is not a wire bug but is worth knowing: HanditemConfiguration's client reads four
// flags -- isHanditemControlBlocked, chooserDisabled, freeFurniMovementsEnabled, invisibleFurni --
// and this emulator has only the first. The other three are features nobody has built, not fields
// anybody forgot.
//
// This does not demand the existing disagreements be fixed. It fixes their LIST, so a new one
// fails the gate on the commit that introduces it instead of surfacing in a running client.

// Second ratchet: the call-site arity the conflict machinery cannot see.
//
// ConflictDetector excludes partial layouts on purpose (Vortex.Specs/Reasoning/ConflictDetector.cs:96)
// -- a reader that stopped early has claimed nothing, so comparing its count would be noise. But when
// the client scanner fails to resolve an outgoing composer's `push` calls it records exactly that
// shape: `field_count: 0, partial: true` for authority `client_code`. The comparison above then finds
// no client position to disagree with, and the packet is silently exempt from the only wire check
// there is.
//
// The scanner does still resolve the CALL SITE, and writes the arity into the evidence note:
//     "...RoomSettingsCtrl.as:1511 with 2 argument(s); the class writes 0 value(s) to the wire"
// Those two numbers sit in the same file and nothing compared them. That is how `UnbanUserFromRoom`
// (client 2 args, our parser 1) and `RemoveAllRights` (client 1, ours 0) both shipped reading the
// wrong room, with the right answer already written down in docs/habbo-specs.
//
// Arity is not a field count, so the rule is narrow -- measured over all 297 blind-bodied incoming
// notes, only these two shapes exist:
//
//   - ours >= args (227): normal and expected. A composer constructor pushes literals the caller
//     never passes -- SetChatPreferences takes 3 args and pushes a leading `false` (4 fields, and 4
//     is right); WiredSetPreferences takes 6 and pushes a hardcoded 0; SaveRoomSettings takes ONE
//     argument, a data object, and pushes 25 values. Never flagged.
//   - ours < args (70): we read fewer values than the client hands its composer. THIS LIST IS NOT
//     NOISE. It is baselined so a new entry fails the gate, but the entries in it are unread work,
//     not known-benign artifacts. Of the 11 read so far -- the ones where we already parse
//     something, so a short read loses real data -- SEVEN were real:
//         ConfirmPetBreeding   client 4, we read 1  (int, String, int, int)
//         BreedPets            client 3 ints, we read 2
//         GetMarketplaceOffers client 5, we read 4  (trailing Boolean dropped)
//         CallForHelpFrom{ForumMessage,ForumThread,IM,Photo}: every one drops the two trailing
//           strings the client fills for unlawful-category reports -- the reporter's name and
//           email (help_message_name / help_message_email, TopicsFlowHelpController.as:481).
//           The plain CallForHelp parser reads them; these four are the odd ones out.
//     Only three of the eleven were arity artifacts, and they are worth knowing as shapes:
//         MoveWallItem   ctor takes 3 params and pushes param1 and param3 -- param2 never ships.
//         ModAlert, GetMarketplaceItemStats: a trailing field pushed only inside an `if`.
//     The ~59 remaining entries all read 0 on our side. Some are a parser that delegates to a base
//     class (the wired Update* family: UpdateActionMessageParser is 4 lines over
//     UpdateWiredDataParser, so our analyzer counts nothing) -- the mirror of the client-side
//     blindness above. The rest have not been read. Do not treat a baselined entry as cleared.
