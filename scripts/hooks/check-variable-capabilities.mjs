// A wired variable's flags are a promise made to the client, and the client believes it: every
// variable picker in the wired editor filters on one flag and greys out whatever fails it. So a
// variable that declares a capability it cannot honour is offered to the builder, selected, saved --
// and then does nothing, in complete silence. The build passes, the tests pass, a grep finds the
// class. It only looks alive.
//
// Two things this does NOT catch, stated here so a green run is not read as more than it is:
//
//   - a box whose flags are copied from another variable at runtime. The echo box republishes the
//     source's flags unmasked, so nothing about its promises is written down anywhere to compare.
//     Its own silence was a real bug and this check would have slept through it.
//   - a flag that is true and a store that is missing. The room variable that could never be
//     written, the context variable that threw on every access, the shared availability with nowhere
//     to write: every one of those declared exactly the right flags. The lie was further down.
//
// So this is the cross-check for one shape only -- a capability named and not implemented behind it:
//
//   CanInterceptChanges  the "variable changed" trigger listens for a change event. Only a
//                        FurnitureWiredVariableLogic raises one, and only an IWiredDerivedVariable
//                        has the room raise one on its behalf. Anything else is a trigger that can
//                        be configured and can never fire.
//   CanWriteValue        the "change variable value" effect filters on this. The internal bases
//                        refuse every write unless the leaf overrides a hook, so a leaf that
//                        declares it without one is a row the builder can pick and watch do nothing.
//   CanCreateAndDelete   the "give" and "remove" effects filter on this, and the internal bases
//                        refuse both outright.
//
