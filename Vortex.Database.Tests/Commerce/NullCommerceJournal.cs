/// <summary>
/// A journal for the suites that are about something else. It answers every step as fresh, so a flow
/// under test behaves exactly as it would on its first attempt — which is what a test of the flow
/// itself wants. Idempotence has its own suites.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// It does keep a note of what it was asked to record. Not to assert on the journal's behaviour,
/// which belongs on the real one over a real schema, but to answer the one question a fake can
/// answer honestly: whether the flow journalled at all. Three flows were found moving money without
/// ever opening an operation, and a double that discarded everything is why nothing noticed.
