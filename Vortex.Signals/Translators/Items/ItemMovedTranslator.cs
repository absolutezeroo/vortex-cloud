/// One translator where there were two handlers on the same event, and it raises <b>both</b> actions
/// for a rotation. That is deliberate and predates this design: the client has no separate rotate
/// message, so every rotation has always raised <c>ItemMovedEvent</c>, and quietly excluding
/// rotations from <c>move_item</c> would make existing tasks count less than the day they were
/// written. <c>RotatedInPlace</c> is what makes the narrower signal possible, not a
/// reclassification of the wider one.
