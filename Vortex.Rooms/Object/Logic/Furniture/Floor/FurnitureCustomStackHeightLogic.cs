/// <summary>
/// The magic stack tile: a floor item whose altitude the owner sets by hand, and which everything
/// else then stacks on top of. Carried by 22 definitions in this catalogue — the
/// <c>tile_stackmagic*</c> family and the <c>tile_walk_magic*</c> one.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The tile holds no height of its own: every definition in the family declares
/// <c>stack_height 0</c>, and <c>RoomItem.Height</c> is <c>Z + GetStackHeight()</c>, so writing the
/// chosen height into the item's Z is what makes the tile carry furniture at that altitude. That is
/// also what the widget reads back — <c>CustomStackHeightWidget</c> displays
/// <c>roomObject.getLocation().z</c>, not stuff data — so the height has exactly one home and the
/// dialog cannot disagree with the room.
/// <para>
/// Registering the name matters beyond behaviour: without it these tiles resolve through the
/// provider's fallback to <see cref="FurnitureFloorLogic"/>, and the handler has no way to tell a
/// magic tile from any other furni the client might name in the packet.
