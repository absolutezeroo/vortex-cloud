/// A team scoreboard: the client's <c>furniture_score</c> logic shows the item's raw state value as
/// a number and animates the delta.
/// <para>
/// It is an <see cref="IScoreDisplayComponent"/> rather than a game component, because a board
/// belongs to no game: <c>bb_score_*</c> binds to <c>furniture_score</c> and carries its colour in
/// the classname, while <c>es_score_*</c> binds to the <c>freeze_counter_*</c> keys which carry it in
/// the key, so the colour resolves from the logic key first and falls back to the classname.
/// (<c>fball_score_*</c> is NOT here — the furnidata binds it to <c>furniture_hockey_score</c>, and
/// <see cref="FurnitureHockeyScoreLogic"/> is the same kind of board on that key.) The number is
/// pushed by the game
/// scoreboard presenter on every score change, in or out of a match; it is live display and never
/// persisted.
