/**
 * One row a directory returns, as the shared picker sees it.
 *
 * Twenty endpoints answer this component and the server now names all five of their row shapes --
 * DirectoryRow, CodeDirectoryRow, PlayerDirectoryRow, RoomDirectoryRow, FurnitureDirectoryRow, all
 * in apiTypes. They are not one type and cannot be intersected into one: a table-backed directory
 * sends a numeric id and the two built from distinct codes send the code itself, so `id` is the one
 * field where the five genuinely disagree. This is the reading view over all of them -- id and name
 * always, and each layout extra optional because only the directory that draws it sends it.
 *
 * A caller that needs a numeric id coerces, because the picker cannot know which directory answered.
