/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// It exists so the shop is FINISHED before any PSP is signed. Every part that is hard to get right —
/// the price snapshot, the signature, the replay guard, the deterministic operation id, the owed-past-
/// the-pivot grant — runs identically here and under a real provider, so the first real integration
/// is one class implementing three members and not a rewrite of the shop.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It hosts no payment page, so <see cref="StartAsync"/> answers null and the site shows the order as
/// pending. That is honest: nothing has been charged, and nothing pretends to have been.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Its notification is the generic shape, which makes it the format a dashboard button or a curl
/// command uses. That is not a weakness — it is signed with the same secret as everything else, and
/// an operator who holds that secret is already allowed to hand out credits.
