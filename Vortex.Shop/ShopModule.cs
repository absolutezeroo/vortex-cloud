/// <para>
/// <c>Manual</c> is always registered, including once a real PSP exists: a bank transfer, a
/// competition prize paid as credits, or a payment the provider lost still have to be settled, and

/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The configuration is NOT validated on start. An unconfigured shop is a perfectly good state — most
