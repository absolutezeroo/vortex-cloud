/// The avatar editor already refuses to offer a sellable set the player has not unlocked, but that
/// is the client judging itself against a list it holds. This is the untrusted edge, so the same
/// rule is applied here: a look wearing something the account does not own is refused whole rather
/// than quietly stripped, because a half-applied figure is worse than an unchanged one.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The check fails open by construction — a hotel that has not seeded the sellable list finds
/// nothing to refuse — and <c>clothing.enforce_ownership</c> turns it off outright. That switch
/// exists because this sits on the path every look change takes: if the seeded data and the hotel's
/// figuredata ever disagree, the symptom is players unable to change clothes at all, and waiting for
/// a rebuild to undo that would be the wrong trade.
/// </para>

/// This is also how a whole-avatar costume comes off. The editor sends this packet when the look was
/// its own rather than one of the NFT tab's avatars, and sends nothing else to say so — so a saved
/// look is the signal, and the worn avatar is dropped here. Nothing is restored: the figure the
/// player just chose <em>is</em> what they want to look like.
