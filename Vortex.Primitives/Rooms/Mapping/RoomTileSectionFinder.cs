/// <summary>
/// Which surfaces of a tile you can actually stand on, given what is stacked there.
///
/// Pure arithmetic over altitudes: no room, no grain, no items — the caller flattens its furniture
/// into <see cref="RoomTileOccupant" />s first. That is what makes the rule below testable at all,
/// and it is the rule that decides whether an avatar can walk *under* a raised platform, which is
/// the point of the exercise.
///
/// A tile offers one candidate surface per occupant top, plus the model's own floor. A candidate is
/// usable when two things hold:
///
///   nothing straddles it   an item with <c>Bottom &lt; S &lt; Top</c> passes through the surface,
///                          so there is no standing on it. The item *forming* S has
///                          <c>Top == S</c> and is therefore not straddling — that strict
///                          comparison is the whole distinction between "I am on it" and "I am
///                          inside it".
///   there is headroom      the nearest thing resting at or above S must be at least
///                          <see cref="Clearance" /> higher. An item sitting exactly on S gives
///                          zero headroom, which is correct: you do not stand under a chair, you
///                          stand on it, and that is the chair's own surface one candidate up.
