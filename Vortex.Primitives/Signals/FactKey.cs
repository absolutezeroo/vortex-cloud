/// The kind is what makes a filter editor generic. Before it, the dashboard hardcoded which facts

/// one page — so any other system wanting filters would have had to write all of it again.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The key is stored in content (<c>reward_track_step_filters.fact_key</c> and the equivalent
/// columns of any later consumer). It is therefore append-only: a renamed key silently stops
/// matching every filter already written on it, which no build and no test would notice. Add keys,
/// never rename or remove them.

/// the editor readable when a translation lags behind.
