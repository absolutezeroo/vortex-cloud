/// The action codes a reward-track task can be defined on. A task names one of these in its

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// These are content identifiers, not behaviour: nothing here is a class, a switch arm or a
/// handler. Adding a task to a campaign picks a code; adding a <em>new</em> code means there is a
/// new gameplay signal to bridge, and only then is there code to write — one event handler in
/// <c>RewardTrackEventHandlers</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// THE STRING IS THE CLIENT'S ARTWORK KEY, AND THE CLIENT SETTLES IT. <c>RewardTrackTaskRowView</c>
/// builds the icon name as <c>"reward_track_tasks_" + actionType.toLowerCase()</c> and nothing else,
/// so a code that is not one of Habbo's own leaves the task with a blank square and a
/// <c>ResourceManager: Asset not found</c> warning. The vocabulary is therefore fixed by the thirty
/// <c>reward_track_tasks_*</c> embeds declared in the client's <c>HabboWindowManagerCom.as</c> — not
/// by <c>external_flash_texts</c>, which an earlier version of this file cited. That mistake is why
/// twelve of these codes used to be invented names (<c>visit_rooms</c>, <c>chat_with_users</c>,
/// <c>place_furniture</c>, …) and every task in the Introduction Track rendered without an icon.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <c>external_flash_texts</c> governs a different string: a task's <c>task_id</c>, which becomes
/// the localization stem <c>reward_track.&lt;track&gt;.task.&lt;task_id&gt;.name</c>. The two spaces
/// do not line up — the Introduction Track's <c>visit_rooms</c> task is driven by the
/// <c>enter_other_users_room</c> action — and a seed must not reuse one for the other.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The last six codes have no Habbo artwork at all: they are this hotel's own signals, and a task
/// defined on one shows an empty icon. That is deliberate — inventing a name would only move the
/// blank square, and borrowing an unrelated icon would lie about what the task is.
