# Document Vortex Cloud

Generate technical documentation for the **current Vortex Cloud codebase**. The documentation must explain how the system actually works, not merely summarize folders or source files.

## Invocation

```text
/document-vortex full
/document-vortex update
/document-vortex validate
/document-vortex topic rooms
/document-vortex topic protocol
/document-vortex topic dashboard
/document-vortex topic economy
/document-vortex topic wireds
/document-vortex topic orleans
/document-vortex topic database
/document-vortex topic networking
/document-vortex topic moderation
/document-vortex topic plugins
/document-vortex full --docs-dir docs/internal/codebase
```

Default output directory: `docs/codebase/`.

## Repository authority and context order

Before analysis, read these files in order when present:

1. `AGENTS.md` — canonical AI/code contract.
2. `CONTEXT.md` — architecture and placement boundaries.
3. `CLAUDE.md` — Claude adapter and required repo automations.
4. `Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Build.targets`, `Directory.Packages.props`, `global.json`.
5. Relevant examples under `docs/patterns/`.
6. Existing documentation related to the selected subsystem.

Treat these categories differently:

- **Code + runtime registration + tests**: primary evidence for implementation facts.
- **AGENTS.md / CONTEXT.md**: primary evidence for intended architectural constraints.
- **docs/habbo-specs/**: primary evidence for known Habbo protocol facts and unknowns.
- **README, audits, ROADMAP, old docs**: orientation and historical evidence only; verify against current code before repeating claims.
- **Reference emulators**: evidence, never authority.
- **Assumptions**: must remain explicit assumptions.

Never overwrite generated content inside `docs/habbo-specs/`.

## Non-negotiable evidence policy

Read `references/evidence-policy.md` before writing documentation.

Every material technical claim must be supported by one or more concrete repository references such as:

- source file + type/method,
- registration site,
- project reference,
- test,
- migration/entity mapping,
- configuration binding,
- generated Habbo spec with confidence metadata.

If evidence is incomplete, write `Unverified` or `Unknown`, then explain what was inspected.

Do not infer official Habbo server behavior merely because Vortex implements it.

## Goal

Produce documentation useful to a developer who needs to:

- understand the complete architecture,
- locate ownership boundaries quickly,
- follow a client packet end-to-end,
- understand Orleans grain responsibilities and state ownership,
- understand room lifecycle and room tick behavior,
- understand persistence and EF Core mappings,
- understand catalog/economy/inventory/marketplace flows,
- understand dashboard API operations and their relationship to live grain state,
- understand protocol revisions and specs,
- identify extension/plugin points,
- understand observability, startup, deployment and testing,
- safely modify the project without violating repository invariants.

## Mandatory first phase: inventory

Run:

```bash
python .claude/skills/document-vortex/scripts/inventory.py --root . --output .claude/document-vortex-inventory.json
```

If Python is unavailable, reconstruct the same information using `Glob`, `Grep`, `dotnet sln list`, and project files.

Inventory must cover at least:

- solution projects and project references,
- package references,
- executable/host projects,
- Orleans grain interfaces and implementations,
- persistent state usage,
- packet handlers,
- incoming message contracts,
- outgoing composers/serializers,
- revision parsers/serializers/header registries,
- database contexts/entities/configurations/migrations,
- Web API and Dashboard API endpoints,
- configuration keys,
- tests and benchmarks,
- plugins/extension registration,
- relevant generated protocol specs.

The inventory is an index, not documentation. Researchers must still read implementation code.

## Research architecture

Use specialized subagents in parallel when the requested scope spans multiple domains. Researchers are read-only and return structured findings. The coordinator is responsible for final synthesis and documentation writes.

Recommended agents:

- `vortex-architecture-researcher`
- `vortex-runtime-network-researcher`
- `vortex-protocol-researcher`
- `vortex-orleans-researcher`
- `vortex-rooms-wireds-researcher`
- `vortex-gameplay-economy-researcher`
- `vortex-database-researcher`
- `vortex-dashboard-api-researcher`
- `vortex-plugins-observability-researcher`
- `vortex-doc-validator`

Existing repo agents are complementary and may be invoked when relevant:

- `grain-rules-reviewer`
- `wire-truth-auditor`

Do not duplicate their responsibilities when validation can reuse them.

## Required researcher response format

Every researcher must return:

```markdown
# Findings

## Scope inspected
- paths/files

## Confirmed architecture
- Claim
  - Evidence: `path/File.cs` — `Type.Member`

## Runtime flows
### Flow: <name>
1. ...
2. ...
Evidence:
- ...

## Ownership / invariants
- ...

## Public contracts
- grain interfaces / message contracts / endpoints / service interfaces

## Configuration
- key -> consumer -> behavior

## Persistence
- state -> owner -> persistence mechanism

## Tests / validation
- relevant tests and what they prove

## Cross-domain dependencies
- domain -> domain -> reason

## Unknowns / ambiguities
- ...

## Suggested documentation pages
- path -> purpose
```

Researchers must not write final documentation files.

## Domain boundaries to preserve

### Hosting / runtime

Distinguish clearly between:

- process startup,
- DI/service registration,
- Orleans silo/client setup,
- SuperSocket/network gateway,
- runtime/session abstractions,
- packet pipeline,
- dashboard/API hosting,
- supervisor/load generator/benchmark utilities.

Do not call every project a "service" if it is only a library.

### Networking vs protocol

Keep these concepts separate:

- network transport/session framing,
- packet decoding/dispatch pipeline,
- typed incoming messages,
- orchestration handlers,
- domain/grain calls,
- outgoing composer contracts,
- revision-specific serialization and header IDs.

A packet flow should be reconstructed from actual registrations, not guessed from folder names.

### Habbo protocol truth

For any protocol page:

1. inspect `docs/habbo-specs/README.md`,
2. use `Vortex.Specs.Cli` when a feature or packet is central,
3. distinguish `client_confirmed`, reference-emulator evidence, captures, verified/manual blocks, assumptions, conflicts, and unknowns,
4. never promote a numeric header to global protocol truth because IDs are revision-specific,
5. document the embedded default revision separately from external/custom plugin revisions.

When useful, run commands such as:

```bash
dotnet run --project Vortex.Specs.Cli -- analyze <feature-id|PacketName>
dotnet run --project Vortex.Specs.Cli -- conflicts --kind field_count --limit 200
dotnet run --project Vortex.Specs.Cli -- unknowns --severity critical
dotnet run --project Vortex.Specs.Cli -- headers
```

### Orleans ownership

For every important grain, document:

- grain key semantics,
- responsibility,
- mutable live state,
- persistent state and backing store if applicable,
- activation/deactivation behavior,
- timers/reminders,
- cross-grain dependencies,
- outbound composer behavior,
- database access,
- cache coherence expectations,
- concurrency properties from Orleans single-threaded execution,
- callers and public methods.

Do not assume a grain owns data merely because its name matches the entity.

Explicitly verify repository rules such as:

- `PlayerPresenceGrain` outbound routing,
- `RoomDirectoryGrain` room discovery/membership,
- dedicated persistence grains where used,
- no raw DB mutation of grain-owned live state,
- no manual locking inside grains,
- timer-based flush patterns where applicable.

### Rooms and Wireds

Room documentation must reconstruct the actual room lifecycle:

```text
enter request
  -> authorization/discovery
  -> room grain/live state
  -> hydration
  -> unit/session membership
  -> room data/composers
  -> movement/tick/events
  -> furniture/wired/effects
  -> persistence
  -> leave/disconnect/deactivation
```

Only keep steps demonstrated by code.

For Wireds, document:

- trigger/effect/condition model,
- registration/discovery,
- execution context,
- selector/target resolution if present,
- transactions/batches if present,
- recursion/cycle/limit protection,
- room-state mutation boundaries,
- persistence format,
- packet configuration flow,
- serialization back to the client.

Do not flatten distinct Wired abstractions into one generic "engine" unless the implementation does.

### Economy and inventory

Trace money/item ownership changes end-to-end. Cover, where present:

- catalog purchase,
- credits/currencies,
- inventory insertion/removal,
- furniture placement/pickup,
- marketplace,
- collectibles,
- progression rewards,
- limited items,
- transaction boundaries,
- concurrency serialization via grains,
- DB writes and live-state synchronization,
- outgoing wallet/inventory updates.

Pages must identify the authoritative mutation path and not just the UI/handler entrypoint.

### Database

Document:

- DbContexts and responsibility,
- major entity groups,
- entity relationships,
- model configurations,
- important indexes/uniqueness constraints,
- migrations,
- grain-owned vs DB-owned state,
- stores used by Orleans persistent state,
- write patterns and transaction boundaries.

Do not generate a giant property dump as the main database documentation. Prefer bounded-context views, then generated indexes for exhaustive lists.

### Dashboard API

The Dashboard API is not merely CRUD documentation. For each capability, determine whether it:

- queries database read models,
- invokes Orleans grains,
- mutates grain-owned state,
- performs an operation/command,
- relies on live runtime state,
- emits audit events,
- requires a permission/capability,
- has a corresponding dashboard route/UI.

Flag documentation when an admin operation could cause DB/live-state divergence if implemented incorrectly. Do not claim an endpoint is safe merely because it persists successfully.

### Plugins and revisions

Explain:

- plugin discovery/loading,
- extension contracts,
- lifecycle,
- revision registration,
- default embedded revision vs custom revision plugins,
- assembly isolation or loading behavior if implemented,
- configuration and failure handling.

## Required end-to-end flows

A `full` run should reconstruct and document, if implemented:

1. process startup to accepting a client connection,
2. connection -> SSO/authentication -> player presence,
3. incoming packet -> parser -> typed message -> handler -> domain/grain -> composer -> revision serializer -> session,
4. room enter -> hydration -> active membership -> leave,
5. movement/tick update path,
6. furniture placement/pickup,
7. wired execution,
8. catalog purchase -> wallet/inventory mutation,
9. marketplace listing/purchase,
10. friend/social action,
11. dashboard admin mutation -> live system effect,
12. persistence flush/deactivation,
13. plugin/revision load.

If a flow is not implemented or cannot be proven, mark it accordingly.

```

Adapt the tree when the actual implementation makes a different grouping clearer.

## Page requirements

Each architecture/domain page should normally contain:

1. Purpose
2. Scope
3. Key types/projects
4. Architecture
5. Runtime flow(s)
6. State ownership
7. Persistence
8. Cross-domain dependencies
9. Configuration
10. Failure/concurrency considerations
11. Extension points
12. Tests/validation
13. Known unknowns
14. Sources

Do not force empty sections.

## Mermaid requirements

Use Mermaid only when it increases comprehension. Preferred diagrams:

- project dependency overview,
- request/packet sequence diagrams,
- Orleans ownership map,
- room lifecycle state diagram,
- DB/live-state ownership diagram,
- plugin/revision loading flow.

Every Mermaid node and edge representing implementation behavior must be traceable to evidence.

Avoid unreadable 50-node diagrams. Split by domain.

## Generated indexes

Generated index pages may be exhaustive. They should be clearly labeled as generated/reference material and not substitute for explanatory documentation.

Recommended tables:

### Project index

| Project | Kind | Responsibility | Direct project references | Key packages |

### Grain index

| Interface | Implementation | Key type | State/persistence | Responsibility |

### Handler index

| Incoming message | Handler | Domain call | Main outgoing composer(s) | Revision mapping |

### Endpoint index

| Method | Route | Operation | Authorization | Data/live-state dependencies |

### Entity index

| Entity | Table | Domain | Key relationships | Important constraints |

## `full` mode

1. Load repository contracts.
2. Run inventory.
3. Inspect current docs to avoid duplicate/conflicting pages.
4. Spawn all required research agents in parallel.
5. Synthesize domain boundaries and end-to-end flows.
6. Write generated indexes.
7. Write explanatory documentation.
8. Create or update `docs-dir/.documentation-state.json` containing:
   - documented commit SHA,
   - timestamp,
   - generator version `document-vortex-v1`,
   - output directory,
   - domains generated.
9. Run the validator agent.
10. Fix evidence/consistency issues found by validation.

## `update` mode

1. Read `.documentation-state.json`.
2. Resolve its prior commit SHA and current `HEAD`.
3. Run:

```bash
git diff --name-status <documented-sha>..HEAD
```

4. Map changed files to impacted documentation domains using `references/domain-map.md`.
5. Re-run inventory.
6. Re-run only relevant researchers plus architecture researcher if project references/hosting/contracts changed.
7. Update affected generated indexes.
8. Revalidate links and cross-domain flows.
9. Update state SHA only after successful documentation validation.

If the prior commit no longer exists, fall back to `full` analysis rather than guessing.

## `topic <domain>` mode

Document only the selected domain plus the minimum neighboring systems necessary to explain its flows correctly.

Examples:

- `topic wireds`: rooms, relevant packets, furniture/wired model, persistence, revision serializers.
- `topic dashboard`: Dashboard API, auth/capabilities, read models, grain operations, DB/live ownership.
- `topic protocol`: networking/pipeline/messages/revisions/specs; do not expand all gameplay domains.
- `topic orleans`: grain topology, ownership, persistence, routing, lifecycle, concurrency.

## `validate` mode

Do not rewrite the whole documentation. Validate:

- source references still exist,
- named symbols still exist when practical,
- project names match current solution,
- diagrams do not contradict prose,
- links between pages are valid,
- protocol claims preserve confidence/unknown distinctions,
- grain ownership claims are backed by implementation,
- no docs claim direct handler socket sends when repository contract forbids them,
- no docs encourage raw DB writes for grain-owned state,
- no stale file paths from refactors,
- generated indexes reflect current inventory.

Use `vortex-doc-validator`. For grain/protocol-sensitive docs, also consider the repository's existing `grain-rules-reviewer` and `wire-truth-auditor`.

## Quality bar

Bad documentation:

> `Vortex.Rooms contains room-related classes.`

Good documentation:

> `Vortex.Rooms owns the live room domain. Room membership/discovery is coordinated through the directory grain, while room-specific state and mutations are handled by room grains and supporting services/persistence components. Packet handlers should only orchestrate entry requests and route through canonical grain APIs rather than maintaining an independent room registry.`
>
> Sources: concrete files/types are then listed and verified for the current revision.

The goal is **operational understanding**.

## Anti-patterns

Do not:

- document every class individually as the primary output,
- copy XML comments into Markdown,
- derive architecture only from `.csproj` references,
- equate database schema ownership with live-state ownership,
- treat packet handler behavior as the protocol specification,
- hide contradictory evidence,
- erase known unknowns from Habbo specs,
- invent server behavior from client packet structure,
- describe stale audits as current state without verification,
- modify production code while documenting unless explicitly requested,
- edit `docs/habbo-specs/generated` content manually,
- overwrite unrelated existing `.claude` agents or skills.

## Completion report

At completion, report succinctly:

- mode executed,
- commit documented,
- pages generated/updated,
- domains covered,
- unresolved unknowns that materially affect understanding,
- validation status.
