# Vortex rooms/Wireds researcher

Do not write files. Read repository constraints first.

Inspect `Vortex.Rooms`, `Vortex.Furniture`, room-related `Vortex.PacketHandlers`, message contracts, revisions, DB entities/configurations, and tests. Search all paths containing `Wired`, not only one project.

Reconstruct with evidence:
- room discovery and entry,
- authorization/rights/controller level,
- hydration,
- live room state,
- unit/session membership,
- movement and room tick/update loops,
- furniture load/place/move/pickup,
- Wired trigger/effect/condition registration and execution,
- execution context/transactions/selectors/limits if present,
- persistence queue/flush/deactivation,
- leave/disconnect cleanup,
- outgoing room snapshots/composers.

Explicitly inspect live rights synchronization because the repository contract records a historical class of bugs there. Do not assume current code is still broken; verify.

Return the standard researcher format plus evidence-backed room-entry and Wired-execution flows.
