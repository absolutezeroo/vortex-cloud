# Vortex.Dashboard.API embeds Vite's output from Assets\, and Assets\ is generated, not committed
# (see the .csproj), so the build context never carries it. The SDK image has no Node, so the
# .csproj's own front-end target died with "npm: not found" and took the publish with it. Built here
# on an image that does have Node, then copied into the build stage.
#
# WORKDIR mirrors the repository layout on purpose: vite.config.js writes to the RELATIVE
# ../Vortex.Dashboard.API/Assets, so the output only lands where the .csproj globs it if this
# directory sits one level under /src like the real one does.

# package-lock.json alone first: as long as the dependencies do not move, editing a .svelte file
# reuses this layer instead of re-downloading the whole tree. `npm ci` rather than `npm install`
# for the same reason the .csproj gives — the lockfile is committed and the build may not move it.

# global.json pins the SDK to "10.0" with rollForward "latestFeature", so the image must carry a
# .NET 10 SDK: a 9.x SDK cannot satisfy that pin and every dotnet command would fail up front with
# "compatible .NET SDK was not found". EF Core / Pomelo staying on the .NET 9 package line (see
# AGENTS.md) does not change this — those are NuGet packages running on the net10.0 runtime.

# --- restore layer -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Only the files that describe the dependency graph are copied here. As long as no project file and
# no pinned package version changes, Docker reuses this layer and the NuGet packages it downloaded,
# so editing source code no longer costs a full restore. Copying the sources first would invalidate
# it on every single edit — which is the whole point of splitting the two.
COPY global.json Directory.Build.props Directory.Build.targets Directory.Packages.props ./

# COPY flattens every match into the destination directory, so the project files land side by side
# in /src and are then moved back under the directory that carries their name. Every project in this
# repository lives at <Name>/<Name>.csproj; if that convention is ever broken, the restore below
# fails loudly with a missing-project error rather than silently building something else.

# --no-restore keeps the cached restore layer authoritative: without it the publish would hit the
# network again and the layering above would buy nothing.
#
# SkipDashboardFrontendBuild is the .csproj's documented opt-out for exactly this: the front-end was
# built in its own stage above, and MSBuild embeds what Assets\ already holds instead of reaching
# for an npm this image does not have.
